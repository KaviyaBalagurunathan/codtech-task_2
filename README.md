OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Objective:
    The program will convert temperatures between three major scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It will enable the user to input a temperature in one scale, select the target scale for conversion, and display the result.

Key Features:

User Input:
    Prompt the user to input the temperature value.
    Allow the user to specify the scale of the input temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
    Let the user select the desired scale for the output.

Interactive Menu:
    Provide a menu for the user to select input and output scales.
    Allow the user to perform multiple conversions or exit the program.

Validation:
    Validate user input to ensure it is numeric and within reasonable bounds (e.g., Kelvin should not be negative).

Output:
    Display the converted temperature in the desired scale with appropriate units.

Planned Steps:
    Define the Conversion Functions:
    Create separate functions for each conversion formula.

Design the User Interface:
    Use a simple text-based menu for user interaction.
    Continuously prompt the user until they decide to exit.

Handle Edge Cases:
    Ensure robust handling of invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
    Account for scientific accuracy in edge cases like absolute zero.

Testing:
    Test with a variety of inputs to ensure the program is accurate and user-friendly.
    
Possible Enhancements:
    Allow batch processing of multiple conversions.
    Add graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
    Extend functionality to include other temperature scales (e.g., Rankine).
    Provide a web-based version using Flask or Django.
